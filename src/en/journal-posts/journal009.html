<p dir="auto">Fuck! I'm so sick of not having any places to chill.<br>
Obviously, I'm exaggerating, there are plenty of places to go. But they always have just enough negatives that it never really feels worth it. I'm not dumb enough to think I live in some idealist world where capitalism doesn't exist, so I know public common spaces aren't profitable. But come on, sheeple! There's gotta be a way to create actual chilling spots with heating/AC and comfy benches to sit on! While we wait for the big corporations of the world to figure out what the public actually wants, here are the best indoor chilling spots when nobody can host, with their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<hr>

<h2 dir="auto">Café</h2>
<h4 dir="auto">Pros:</h4>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">Nice vibe</li>
<li dir="auto">A little coffee's always nice</li>
<li dir="auto">Good temperature</li>
<li dir="auto">Power outlets</li>
</ul>
<h4 dir="auto">Cons:</h4>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">You gotta pay</li>
<li dir="auto">You'd better “know a spot”</li>
<li dir="auto">Extremely variable comfort</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Okay, this one's pretty basic, but it's usually every gen Z's first choice: “wanna hit a café?” And honestly, it's a good choice! It's hard to go wrong with a café: whether it's a professional meeting or chatting with friends, the vibe works for both. There are bathrooms, there are chairs (though sometimes it's a little hard for the derriere), and places to plug in your phone — what more could you ask for? Apart from the fact that, of course, you have to buy something to sit in the café. And that's the main problem with most common spaces: you gotta pay. Understandable, but when it costs $8 for a coffee, chilling gets expensive real fast. Oh well!</p>

<h2 dir="auto">Library</h2>
<h4 dir="auto">Pros:</h4>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">Free!</li>
<li dir="auto">Lots of books and other stuff</li>
<li dir="auto">Maximum comfort</li>
<li dir="auto">You can even sneak a lil nap</li>
</ul>
<h4 dir="auto">Cons:</h4>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">Not great if you want to be loud</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The Mesopotamians cooked when they came up with the idea of putting their texts in one place. Libraries are just so cool. I'm far from the first to say this and definitely not the last, but seriously, go spend more time in your local library. The air is always perfect, there's a shit ton of free knowledge, passionate and kind staff, plus lots of little perks like comfy chairs, computers, and sometimes even zines!! Yeah, I know, anyone reading this who's not terminally online probably doesn't care (your loss honestly, zines are sick). Only thing is, for chilling with friends, unless you all know sign language, it's kinda rough. Still, libraries are one of the best spots out there, period.</p>

<h2 dir="auto">Restaurant</h2>
<h4 dir="auto">Pros:</h4>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">Who doesn't love gathering around food?</li>
<li dir="auto">There's a bunch of them, all the time, everywhere</li>
<li dir="auto">Lots of seating</li>
</ul>
<h4 dir="auto">Cons:</h4>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">Costs money</li>
<li dir="auto">Minimal comfort (sticky seats)</li>
<li dir="auto">If you stay after eating they kill you</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Not a single fucking restaurant on earth seems capable of having comfortable chairs. Overall, not a bad spot to settle and chat, but not everyone has the money (or desire) to spend on restaurant food — which is 100% fair! Plus, since in some places they rush you out the moment you finish eating, it doesn't really encourage you to see it as a chilling spot, more like an in-between before the real chilling. That said, it's hard to argue against it when food is part of the package deal.</p>

<h2 dir="auto">Mall</h2>
<h4 dir="auto">Pros:</h4>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">Not too many people around anymore</li>
<li dir="auto">Surprisingly comfy benches</li>
<li dir="auto">Surreal vibe you can't get anywhere else</li>
<li dir="auto">You can spot old folks on mobility scooters</li>
</ul>
<h4 dir="auto">Cons:</h4>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">Seating always laid out in weird ways</li>
<li dir="auto">Constant audio/visual overstimulation</li>
<li dir="auto">Going extinct</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Honestly, this is an underrated spot in my opinion. I'm not talking about the big malls everyone goes to, I mean places like those half-dead ones where half the stores are shut and the lighting's all weird. Which honestly makes it perfect since barely anyone goes there. Tons of space to sit (though if you're not in the food court it's tricky to find two facing seats), easy access to snacks, and prime people-watching. It's basically a peaceful haven… except when a kid starts screaming. Which is pretty much always it seems.</p>

<h2 dir="auto">College/University common area</h2>
<h4 dir="auto">Pros:</h4>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">Totally free</li>
<li dir="auto">Built for chatting with friends</li>
<li dir="auto">Usually food nearby</li>
<li dir="auto">Easy to drop into between classes</li>
</ul>
<h4 dir="auto">Cons:</h4>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">Only accessible if you're a student</li>
<li dir="auto">Crowded</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">I can only speak for my college, but the common area was a nice spot... As long as you snagged one of the six booths. Otherwise, you were stuck at a wobbly table on an ass-itching chair beside a group of same hairs blasting reels at full volume while laughing so hard they cause a mini-earthquake. Aside from that trauma, it's honestly a really great place for students. Too bad once you're done with school, you lose all of it.</p>

<h2 dir="auto">Bar</h2>
<h4 dir="auto">Pros:</h4>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">Chance to get smashed</li>
<li dir="auto">Very social place?</li>
</ul>
<h4 dir="auto">Cons:</h4>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">Loud</li>
<li dir="auto">Crowded</li>
<li dir="auto">Smells like booze, sweat, and cigs</li>
<li dir="auto">Everything costs too much</li>
<li dir="auto">I'd honestly rather die</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Here's where my bias really shows: I hate bars, clubs, pubs, all that crap. If I want to get drunk, I'll throw a house party — maybe it'll turn into an orgy and I'll end up as the transsexual in the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-vice-guide-to-partying-parties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VICE Guide to Partying</a> (WARNING: super vulgar and dated, but hilarious. Peak journalism, as a great genius once said). But seriously, I'm way too neurodivergent for bars. I'd much rather stay home, even if it means missing out on a hang. That said, my friends swear bars are super fun. Breweries are chill though.</p>

<h2 dir="auto">Hotel lobby?</h2>
<h4 dir="auto">Pros:</h4>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">Relaxed, luxurious atmosphere</li>
<li dir="auto">Super comfy sofas</li>
<li dir="auto">You look like a gang of important business people</li>
</ul>
<h4 dir="auto">Cons:</h4>
<ul>
<li dir="auto">Not sure if it's allowed</li>
<li dir="auto">Not much to do there</li>
<li dir="auto">Constant stimuli</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This one definitely needs testing. In theory, nothing's stopping you, and if they tell you to leave, you just… leave right? It's got that wealth vibe, like you're chatting with your stockbroker buddies around a fountain and a chandelier that doesn't even make physical sense. Definitely worth trying, if anyone reading this tests it out, please leave me a note somewhere, I need to know what it's like.</p>
<hr>

<p dir="auto">I honestly think we need a new kind of spot. But if there's one constant with humanity, it's that we can't have nice things. There's always some asshole who's gonna ruin your dreams and rip up your bean bags. Maybe one day… nah, just kidding, that'll never happen hahaha. My only option left is to move back into an apartment and turn it into an open-door apartment so I can walk in and maybe find my friends already on my couch gaming. Legit a dream.</p>
