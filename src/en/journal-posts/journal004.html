tagline: Because locking in for my job is cringe, but a random-ass hobby? You bet.
footer: Still waiting on the day where I'll hyperfixate on figuring out when someone is into me.

<p dir="auto">I love having a new hyperfixation. Sinking all my time in something for weeks, or even months if I don't give up as soon as I hit any kind of challenge. It's just awesome. But which one of them has been the most fun for me? Is it quantifiable? Which ones do I still fuck around with, and which ones disappeared after a month? And above all, am I one day gonna be able to write a blog post that isn't in the form of a list? Who knows!</p>

<h4 data-heading="Nunchaku" dir="auto">Nunchaku</h4>
<p dir="auto">I started learning how to wield this weapon during quarantine, and I think it's truly the first time where I got this invested in something and sunk most of my free time into it. Nostalgia of my first hyperfixation aside, it's so much fun! It's just physical enough to look impressive, but not too much that it becomes really exhausting super quickly, and it's pretty easy to teach to a friend (which is important if you want to infodump without losing their attention).</p>
<h4 data-heading="Begleri" dir="auto">Begleri</h4>
<p dir="auto">Honestly, kind of like the nunchucks' little cousin. Apart from the fact that they are so easy to lose (like I can't find any of my begleri live), it's a hyperfixation that has zero negatives. It's the type of skill toy you can whip out anywhere, it's built by hand in 5 minutes using hex nuts and paracord, and it's super easy to show people (and let's be real, it looks cool as hell). And since you can crank them out at an industrial speed, you can give them out to all your friends! Or sell them, I don't judge.</p>
<h4 data-heading="Embroidery" dir="auto">Embroidery</h4>
<p dir="auto">Eh... My room's not clean enough for me to be motivated to do embroidery. I'm sure it's tons of fun, but for now I'm gonna put a pin in that (haha).</p>
<h4 data-heading="CD ripping" dir="auto">CD ripping</h4>
<p dir="auto">Pretty fun for a while there! I need to get back into it, but for that I'd need good speakers in my room and an easily accessible storage system to p=give me a push to listen to CDs instead of putting on my headphones. Definitely a project for the near future though.</p>
<h4 data-heading="IndieWeb" dir="auto">IndieWeb</h4>
<p dir="auto">So interesting! It's fun to see everyone's creativity and identity, and browsing inspires me to work on my own things. It takes a lot of brain juice to understand what I'm coding, but whenever it gets too much I can just write a post instead, which uses a different part of my brain. So hooray!</p>
<h4 data-heading="Modding handhelds" dir="auto">Modding handhelds</h4>
<p dir="auto">Not for me. I jailbroke my DSi and PSP, but after it's done I realize I just don't really wanna play the games on these consoles. I have trouble gaming (probably cause I suck at every game), so it's kind of a flop. 'Twas fun while it lasted though, and it allowed me to play Rhythm Heaven, which I thoroughly enjoyed!</p>
<h4 data-heading="Binairos" dir="auto">Binairos</h4>
<p dir="auto">Yum yum yum. The perfect puzzle game for my brain. A 10x10 grid with only two choices per cell, 0 or 1. And I could spend days with only a book of these as entertainment (which I have already done). It's so simple, but becomes pretty complicated once you reach a certain level. It's a pretty zen puzzle, but it captures both my and some of my friends' attention. And since the two symbols are a circle and a line, it's pretty easy to work on puzzles in the same book around the table. Highly recommend it.</p>
<h4 data-heading="Guitar Hero" dir="auto">Guitar Hero</h4>
<p dir="auto">I miss playing Guitar Hero!!!! Unfortunately I don't have a guitar anymore. I should buy a modding kit to get back into it, because I was starting to become pretty good. I adore rhythm games in general, so it's kind of normal that the one I grew up with is the one that takes up more space in my heart and mind. My only gripe with it is the noise. Dear lord this controller is clicking and clacking all over the place.</p>
<h4 data-heading="Mashups" dir="auto">Mashups</h4>
<p dir="auto">I tried so many times to make some by myself, but DAWs and my brain just don't want to work together. So I just listen to those made by other talented folks with a lot of respect and a tiny sliver of jealousy. And I do it silently because apparently mashups aren't as artistic as "real" music. Well you know what, strawman of this argument? You're not even real, so booyah.</p>
<h4 data-heading="DIYing board games" dir="auto">DIYing board games</h4>
<p dir="auto">Really fun to do, but I've got to get better at drawing because the artistic department is LACKING in my games. Nevertheless, it's such a fun pastime, especially when you can bring friends into it (like our huge 1000 Blank White Cards deck that I'm probably gonna talk about in a future post so stay tuned for that ðŸ˜‰).</p>

<p dir="auto">Anyways that's about it for this post, a good overview of a bunch of things that have entertained me, or at least have tried to, for the last 5 years. Not every single post needs to go over 1000 words y'know. LOL (lots of love).</p>
