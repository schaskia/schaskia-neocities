<p dir="auto">I'm great at coming up with ideas, but terrible at actually making them happen. Every time I tell myself this project will be different, and every time I hit an obstacle that's just a bit too hard to get past, and I quit. Oops!<br>
The problem with that is now I have tons of ideas, all at different stages of creation, and I know some of them are worth revisiting but they fill me with existential dread the second I even think about starting again. So, in an effort to once again cleanse myself of the shame living inside my body, I'm gonna show off a few of these ideas in hopes that it'll either rekindle my spark or inspire someone else to pick them up for me :3</p>

<h2 data-heading="Mushroom Deckbuilder" dir="auto">Mushroom deckbuilder</h2>
<h4 data-heading="Reason for giving up: couldn't come up with a good win condition ;-;" dir="auto">Reason for giving up: couldn't come up with a good win condition ;-;</h4>
<p dir="auto">I liked this idea a lot, but like every other board game I've abandoned, I aimed way too high for my current skill level. Basically, I wanted to make a deckbuilder (like Magic, Pokémon, etc.) where card positioning actually matters and the focus is more on building your own strategy than ruining other people's. And what better theme than two patches of land covered in mushrooms fighting for... uh, what exactly? And that was the problem: I never figured out what drives the game, what makes one player win and the other lose. I still really like the concept, but I should probably make at least one working game before going back to it.</p>

<h2 data-heading="Cross-stitched Binding of Isaac patches" dir="auto">Cross-stitched Binding of Isaac patches</h2>
<h4 data-heading="Reason for giving up: my canvas is too big and I don't have enough colors" dir="auto">Reason for giving up: my canvas is too big and I don't have enough colors</h4>
<p dir="auto">The goal here was to make little patches so I could have clothes covered in Binding of Isaac items, because it's actually cool to be proudly nerdy now (but mostly because I like the look of clothes covered in tiny icons). Turns out, most of the items are made up of like eight shades of beige, taupe, and brown, colors I definitely don't have in my beginner kit. Plus, each item has like four layers of shading, so I need a ton of thread colors. Ideally, I'd convert all the items to a shared 48-color palette so I can just buy specific threads without spending like 200 bucks on a whole set.</p>

<h2 data-heading="Discord Escape Game" dir="auto">Discord escape game</h2>
<h4 data-heading="Reason for giving up: just lost interest I guess?" dir="auto">Reason for giving up: just lost interest I guess?</h4>
<p dir="auto">Back during COVID when no one had anything to do, I invited some friends to help me make an escape game that would take place entirely on a Discord server. Each channel would be a different room with clues hidden inside, and you'd give codes to a bot to unlock new channels and eventually escape. I probably don't need to explain what an escape game is, everyone knows, but oh well! Anyway, this was another idea where I actually had everything I needed: I know how to make a server, I know how to build a working code system, but the interest just disappeared. I don't think anyone in my circle would even care if I finished it. So yeah, this one's probably dead forever.</p>

<h2 data-heading="A Whole-Ass Improv League?" dir="auto">A whole-ass improv league?</h2>
<h4 data-heading="Reason for giving up: I hate bureaucracy!!!" dir="auto">Reason for giving up: I hate bureaucracy!!!</h4>
<p dir="auto">Yeah honestly I don't even know what I was thinking with this one. Like, I'd have loved to run a summer improv league in the Vallée-du-Richelieu area if it weren't for the fact that every step of the process is pure torture to me. I hate organizing stuff, I loathe managing money, I would rather kill myself than write emails and do phone calls, basically bureaucracy is my sworn enemy, way too annoying for my queer artist brain. I'd rather daydream about my girlfriend and make bracelets (which is honestly what I've been doing lately, hence why nothing new has gone up on the site for like a month). But hey, at least making the team jerseys was fun lmao. For real though, I think there's room for an improv league on Montreal's Rive-Sud, but unfortunately I'm not the one who'll make it happen. I tried, but never again.</p>

<h2 data-heading="Decorating My Room With My Own Posters" dir="auto">Decorating my room with my own posters</h2>
<h4 data-heading="Reason for giving up: too lazy to put them on a USB and get them printed" dir="auto">Reason for giving up: too lazy to put them on a USB and get them printed</h4>
<p dir="auto">This one pisses me off so much. I have no reason not to do it!! I have tons of cool posters I could hang on my walls, and I just... don't? What the fuck, Saskia, just do it, bitch. Ahem. I definitely have wall space, but the idea of going to a store to print them just feels impossible for some reason. I guess I'm too used to the comfort of my room? Probably yeah. It's definitely still on my to-do list though, since there's literally no excuse left now that the posters are actually done.</p>

<h2 data-heading="Drawing Rocks" dir="auto">Drawing rocks</h2>
<h4 data-heading="Reason for giving up: someone made fun of me :(" dir="auto">Reason for giving up: someone made fun of me :(</h4>
<p dir="auto">Note to Mya: yeah, it was 100% him, and he did it while asking if McFly and Carlito would be at Regard.<br>
Ok for everyone else, here's the full story. Around the time I moved for college, I started making these goofy little drawings of rocks (or representations of them) for a queer audience. It's kinda cheesy, but whatever, it's fun! It's goofy, my friends liked it, I put a few on Redbubble because why not, and I made an Artstation account to drop them all on because I was having fun with it. I stopped after my first semester because, you know, neurodivergence, gotta move on to the next hobby, and I kinda forgot about it. Fast forward three semesters later: I'm in a pre-production class (which I already hate), and this fucking dude I used to get along with pretty well (not anymore, shocker) decides to Google my name (fuck you, by the way), finds my Artstation with all my silly doodles, and mocks me?? In class??? Die!!!!! Die 1000 times, and once you're done, die 1000 more times!! I lost all my pride in this project because of a serial cheater?? Unthinkable. I'm not even naming him, partly out of respect but mostly because he doesn't deserve the attention. There are millions of guys like him. Fuck you, man.</p>

<hr>
<p dir="auto">Sadly, for every project I finish, eight others die halfway through. I've learned to accept it with time, to be proud of what I've done despite it all, and I keep telling myself that maybe one day I'll revisit one of these ideas, even though we all know that's never happening. C'est la vie!</p>
