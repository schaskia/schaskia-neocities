<p dir="auto">I've been looking at the posts I've written for a few days now, and I can't help but think that I've set the bar pretty high for myself. Who came up with the idea of writing 1000+ word posts on really vague topics that take up 50% of my talking points every 3 days? So today I'm forcing myself to do a micro-blog, much more stream of consciousness, to remind myself that it's okay to take it easy, especially if it's a hobby, y'know.</p>
<p dir="auto">I have such a hard time beginning to create things, it's actually insane. It's like there's something blocking me and I'm unable to find the first step, I absolutely have to do everything at once or I'm a failure. Like if I start a poster and I don't immediately have an idea that I like, or if I can't bring my idea to life after 30 minutes, or if when it's time to refine my design I'm suddenly not sure about it anymore, 90% of the time I give up. Straight up. And that sucks a bit because it discourages me from doing more graphic design, or anything for that matter! Like if every time I try to do something creative I fail, it doesn't look good for the next creative things I want to do. I still have a huge backlog of projects that I'd love to do, but they'll probably never see the light of day just because it's so much work and I can't untangle the knot into smaller steps, so I just end up staring at the pile of problems completely dumbfounded instead of just starting somewhere (I have so many board game ideas hidden across a thousand note-taking apps, it's sad).</p>
<p dir="auto">The silver lining is that it gets a lot better when I work with someone else. If I have a friend who puts a little pressure on me and helps me bounce off ideas, my creative blockage gets released and the chaos in my brain gradually gets organized. I imagine I'm not the only one like this, but in my case it's a bit of a problem, since I'm stuck in a loop where I'm now almost incapable of working on certain types of projects (especially writing) without being accompanied because I'm no longer confident in my skills. Oops.</p>
<p dir="auto">Anyways, that's about all I have to say on the subject for now. I'm sure that if I dug deeper I could write more, but I'm setting a limit of 500 words to avoid discouragement and also just to see if I prefer shorter writings, even if it means starting ideas and never finishing them like a mysterious author that young people are forced to read in high school. I'm not even going to proofread, it's probably going to be full of mistakes. Ciao ciao!</p>
