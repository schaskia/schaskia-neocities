You like learning about a variety of topics that you can integrate into your creative endeavors, and you tend to hang out in fandom spaces. You can sometimes be passive, but you're learning to come out of your shell. When a friend wants to have a chill hangout session, they know they can count on you."

You like making new friends and are warm to everyone, but when something upsets you, you can get really fired up! You can be stubborn and make enemies as a result. However, you're able to let go of grudges when you see the other person's good side or realize your fault. Your relationships with friends and family are fire-forged, and you cherish those bonds dearly."

Sometimes, your competitiveness can get the best of you, but you try to put your determination to good use. Some people are intimidated by you, while others are inspired by your charm and boldness. Once they get to know you, they end up agreeing that you're quite fun to be around."

Otherwise, you have quick wits and thick skin, and you know how to use your best qualities to take advantage of any situation. When your friends aren't sure what to do, they know that you'll help them come up with a solution."

At the end of the day, you're usually content to sit back and relax and enjoy whatever life throws your way as much as you can."

When this does happen, though, you tend not to mind… after all, you're a pretty laid-back person."
