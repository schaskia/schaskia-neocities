          <p>I have this game I LOVE to play when I'm the one on the aux and I don't know the group's vibe that well. The rules are simple: you give me a moment, I give you the track that would accompany it. Then we swap roles. Super easy to understand, super fun to play to get to know someone musically. And since I love talking about music and I love standing out in a weird and arbitrary way, I thought a fun little game would be the perfect setup to share the songs I like. So without further ado, here are 5 songs that go hand in hand with moments shared with Mother Nature.</p>
        <h2>1. You lay down in the grass to watch the stars with your significant other</h2>
        <h4>Armistice — Mission Bells</h4>

        <p>Imagine this for a second : You're both looking up at the stars by yourselves, there are a bunch of match cuts when you're singing one by one and you're next to one another (or head to head) when singing together. And then, during the instrumental break, it's kinda like in LEGO games when the two characters get closer, your split screen becomes a single screen and it's revealed that you were right next to each other this whole time. Boom, absolute cinema. Anyways, despite its lyrics, the song feels naive in a way that perfectly captures the sort of bubble you're in in a teenage relationship, and the harmonies are melting together so well they might as well be making out.</p>

        <p>Ok watch this. You're trapped in a ring of fire, there are trees falling in the distance, you know time is running out, so you start to make a run for it. When suddenly, BANG! Your girlfriend from the last song falls to the ground. She sprained her ankle and can no longer run. You feel the adrenaline start to boil inside you (probably cause it's so hot #joke). You pick her up princess-style in your arms and make a run for it. Burnt trunks fall around you, burning branches try to lacerate you and give you third degree burns, but you don't even have time to think about it because all that matters to you is saving your future life partner. Did I mention you're both lesbians?</p>

        <p>Finally some peace after the storm! Or maybe after the fire? Anyways that's not what matters, the important part is that you and your girlfriend are safe, and that you know following that traumatic event that you want to spend your life with her. So you decide to take a trip to a remote cabin with her to propose to her. You're both fishing, when you get down on one knee and look her in the eyes. You ask her the question and she screams yes before taking you in her arms. You look at the sunset together in pure bliss. Cue in this song, whose synths mixed with Brian David Gilbert's voice soothes the soul and calms the mind, allowing the comforting rays of the sun to pass through the cloudy skies and enveloping you with warmth and love.</p>

        <p>Second year of licing together. You decide to buy a house together. Your dream of becoming a cottagecore manual labor woman wearing picnic tablecloth adjacent button-ups is finally coming true! Only thing is that living outside the city is hard work. Edit of you and your wife, as well as the dog you adopted, working to create a livable home : Cleaning the house, removing weeds in the garden, planting vegetables, building furniture, chopping wood (but not like a thirst trap where you chop like 2-3 logs, more like enough wood to last at least one dull winter). Every action is rythmically tied to the song, of course. The intensity of your hard work crescendoes until the end, where you collapse from exhaustion in your newly finished garden under the scorching hot sun.</p>
        <h2>5. You bleed out in the snow</h2>

        <p>This winter's rough. The kind of winter that seeps in through your pores to grip your bones directly. But you need to bring back meat for your wife, your dog and the kid you adopted. After all, nothing soothes the soul more than a piece of moose meat on a cold day where even the Earth had to put on a coat of snow to warm up a little. Only problem is that the moose also knows how to fight. And he managed to get his antler fully through your body. You cling on to life with all you've got to get back home, just so you can die surrounded by those you love. The constant switch between 3/4 and 4/4 mimics your irregular steps filled with pain, and yet you keep moving forward. the song takes its sweet time to let you bleed out, and just as you were about to reach your wife's arms, the song decides to kill you prematurely in front of her. She cries on your wound, hoping to heal you with the power of her sadness like a real-life Rapunzel, but it's in vain. Right before letting the cold winter air bring you into the afterlife, you sign to your wife to get closer and whisper in her ear : « the song's lyrics, even though they are completely detached from the situation, create a sort of mysticism around death and manage to make you feel like life is flashing before your eyes. » Congrats, You just broke the fourt wall in my cottagecore lesbian fanfic. Are you proud of yourself? Asshole.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, if you've got moments that make you think "Oh my god I would love it if my favorite transgender woman could mansplain me a song that would fit well" or if you're a lesbian that has always dreamed of leaving the frantic rhythm of urban life to go move out in the countryside with a docile housewife that almost knows how to cook (that's me), please shoot me a message anywhere scream it into the universe hoping it reaches me.</p>
